/* Here's a hint! If we want to assign a variable called "person" the value that the user has entered in the "Someone's Name" text box, we can do this:

	var person = document.getElementById("person").value;

Now if we wanted to take that variable and insert it into the page, we could place it in the "story" div like this:

	var storyDiv = document.getElementById("story");
	storyDiv.innerHTML = person;

The final piece of the puzzle is to add an onclick event handler -- in this case, we want our program to execute when the user clicks the button. Use the syntax we learned today to make this work. */
